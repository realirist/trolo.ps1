Update Log:

## UPDATE 23/4/2025
Added a check for if the content is shutdownAll, and then it shutdowns everyone running the script.

## UPDATE 3/10/2025
so uhh this is a big log of stuff that happened with the script through the year because uhh im busy and cant make a proper README.md sooo
* fixed shutdownAll typo, can now shutdown
* added abortOperationAll, deletes most traces of it ever existing
* made a game to make people trust, basically the installer looks like the actual installer of the script so it can confuse people into using the script instead of the game.
* fixed game stuff but still need to fix some hitboxes aaaaaaaaa
* proper installer, gets from cloud instead of hardcoding the latest update
* made title say v2.2 instead of trolo v2 due to trust
